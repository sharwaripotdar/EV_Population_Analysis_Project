# EV_Population_Analysis_Project

Data Analysis Project Using Python

The Electric Vehicle Population Analysis project aims to explore and analyze the distribution, trends, and characteristics of electric vehicles (EVs) 
using a dataset from the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL). 

The project provides insights into EVs' types, growth, and electric range, particularly Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).

# Project Overview
**Objective:**  Examine the trends and dynamics of electric vehicle adoption, emphasizing Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), through comprehensive analysis of the Washington State Department of Licensing dataset.

**Tools:** 

Pandas, Numpy - Data manupilation and analysis

Matplotlib, Seaborn - Data visualization

**Dataset:** The project utilizes the Electric Vehicle dataset provided by the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL), including information on VIN, County, City, Model Year, Electric Vehicle Type, Electric Range, Base MSRP, Legislative District, and more.

# Results and Interpretation

1) **Distribution Analysis:** The analysis reveals that Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) constitute a dominant 70% of the electric vehicle population, indicating a strong preference for fully electric propulsion.

2) **EV Population Over Time:**  Analyze the growth of the EV population by model year.

3) **Geographical Distribution:** Understand where EVs are most commonly registered

4) **Make and Model Popularity:** Identify the most popular makes and models among the registered EVs.

5) **Electric Range Analysis:** Analyze the electric range of vehicles to see how EV technology is progressing.
